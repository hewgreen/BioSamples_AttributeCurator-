# BioSamples_AttributeCurator-
A holistic python approach to semi-automated curation of BioSamples attributes.

## Missing on Git

1. ./data becuase input data is too large
1. attributes.csv - generated by input.py
1. coexistences.csv - generated by input.py
1. coexistences.gexf - generated by input.py
1. samples.csv - generated by input.py
1. values.csv - example file only, input module has not been developed (issues with Solr crash and lack of data in biosamples v4)
1. ./log becuase log files are generated internally
